"""
This module provides functionality for managing analytics rules in Typesense (V1).

Classes:
    - AnalyticsRulesV1: Handles operations related to analytics rules.

Methods:
    - __init__: Initializes the AnalyticsRulesV1 object.
    - __getitem__: Retrieves or creates an AnalyticsRuleV1 object for a given rule_id.
    - create: Creates a new analytics rule.
    - upsert: Creates or updates an analytics rule.
    - retrieve: Retrieves all analytics rules.

Attributes:
    - resource_path: The API resource path for analytics rules.

The AnalyticsRulesV1 class interacts with the Typesense API to manage analytics rule operations.
It provides methods to create, update, and retrieve analytics rules, as well as access
individual AnalyticsRuleV1 objects.

For more information on analytics, refer to the Analytics & Query Suggestion
[documentation](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html)

This module uses type hinting and is compatible with Python 3.11+ as well as earlier
versions through the use of the typing_extensions library.
