"""
This module provides functionality for managing individual synonyms in Typesense.

Classes:
    - Synonym: Handles operations related to a specific synonym within a collection.

Methods:
    - __init__: Initializes the Synonym object.
    - _endpoint_path: Constructs the API endpoint path for this specific synonym.
    - retrieve: Retrieves the details of this specific synonym.
    - delete: Deletes this specific synonym.

The Synonym class interacts with the Typesense API to manage operations on a
specific synonym within a collection. It provides methods to retrieve and delete
individual synonyms.

For more information regarding Synonyms, refer to the Synonyms [documentation]
(https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/synonyms.html#synonyms).

This module uses type hinting and is compatible with Python 3.11+ as well as earlier
versions through the use of the typing_extensions library.
