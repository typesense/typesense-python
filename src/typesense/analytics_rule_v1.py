"""
This module provides functionality for managing individual analytics rules in Typesense (V1).

Classes:
    - AnalyticsRuleV1: Handles operations related to a specific analytics rule.

Methods:
    - __init__: Initializes the AnalyticsRuleV1 object.
    - _endpoint_path: Constructs the API endpoint path for this specific analytics rule.
    - retrieve: Retrieves the details of this specific analytics rule.
    - delete: Deletes this specific analytics rule.

The AnalyticsRuleV1 class interacts with the Typesense API to manage operations on a
specific analytics rule. It provides methods to retrieve and delete individual rules.

For more information on analytics, refer to the Analytics & Query Suggestion
[documentation](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html)

This module uses type hinting and is compatible with Python 3.11+ as well as earlier
versions through the use of the typing_extensions library.
