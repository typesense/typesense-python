"""
This module provides functionality for managing synonyms in Typesense.

Classes:
    - Synonyms: Handles operations related to synonyms within a collection.

Methods:
    - __init__: Initializes the Synonyms object.
    - __getitem__: Retrieves or creates a Synonym object for a given synonym_id.
    - _endpoint_path: Constructs the API endpoint path for synonym operations.
    - upsert: Creates or updates a synonym.
    - retrieve: Retrieves all synonyms for the collection.

Attributes:
    - RESOURCE_PATH: The API resource path for synonyms.

The Synonyms class interacts with the Typesense API to manage synonym operations
within a specific collection. It provides methods to create, update, and retrieve
synonyms, as well as access individual Synonym objects.

For more information regarding Synonyms, refer to the Synonyms [documentation]
(https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/synonyms.html#synonyms).

This module uses type hinting and is compatible with Python 3.11+ as well as earlier
versions through the use of the typing_extensions library.
